    <p>PhD in biophysics with strong interest in mathematics, programming and
      computational biology. My scientific expertise covers various aspects of biotechnology and molecular biology.<br>
      My PhD thesis dealt with development of biosensors for small molecules detection.
      Prior to that, I have spent 2+ years in biotech industry as biologist, so I have both academy and industry experience.<br>
      I also have extensive experience in biotechnological methods development and evaluation,
      particularly qualitative and quantitative analysis designing and testing. </p>
